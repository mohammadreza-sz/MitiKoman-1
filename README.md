## how to use  colab with git

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aryansabet/MitiKoman/)  

Using Google Colab with GitHub
Google Colaboratory is designed to integrate cleanly with GitHub, allowing both loading notebooks from github and saving notebooks to github.  

Loading Public Notebooks Directly from GitHub
Colab can load public github notebooks directly, with no required authorization step.  

- For example, consider the notebook at this address: https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb.   

- The direct colab link to this notebook is: https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb.  

-*** To generate such links in one click, you can use the Open in Colab Chrome extension.  ***


- `http://colab.research.google.com/github` will give you a general github browser, where you can search for any github organization or username.  
- `http://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/`will open the repository browser for the googlecolab organization. Replace googlecolab with any other github org or user to see their repositories.  
- `http://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/` will let you browse the main branch of the colabtools repository within the googlecolab organization. Substitute any user/org and repository to see its contents.  
- `http://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master` will let you browse master branch of the colabtools repository within the googlecolab organization. (don't forget the blob here!) You can specify any valid branch for any valid repository.
